## part 2: Create text file with parameters needed to the algorithm
### Input:
- field size
- starting point (x,y)
- end point (x,y)
- random polygons:
  - N - number of icebergs.
  - Dots - number of dots in each iceberg.
  - R - radios size for each iceberg.
  
### Output: text file
- field boundry (x-axis)
- field boundry (y-axis)
- x_start y_start
- x_end y_end
- Number of icebergs
- #1 (iceberg number)
- 1_dots (number of dots in iceberg #1)
- x_1 y_1
- x_2 y_2
- .....
- #2 (iceberg number)
- 1_dots (number of dots in iceberg #2)
- x_1 y_1
- x_2 y_2
- .....
  
  
## part 2: read the file in C++

## part 3: convex Hull problem

## part 4: path planning solution - A*

## part 5: Dubbins model
