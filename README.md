## Eskimo path  planning
Path planning algorithms

#part 1: create text file with parametrs needed to the algorithm

input:
- field size
- starting point (x,y)
- end point (x,y)
- random polygons:
  - N - number of icebergs.
  - Dots - number of dots in each iceberg.
  - R - radios size for each iceberg.
  
  output: text file
  
  format:
  
  field boundry (x-axis)
  field boundry (y-axis)
  x_start y_start
  x_end y_end
  Number of icebergs
  #1 (iceberg number)
  1_dots (number of dots in iceberg #1)
  x_1 y_1
  x_2 y_2
  .....
  #2 (iceberg number)
  1_dots (number of dots in iceberg #2)
  x_1 y_1
  x_2 y_2
  .....
  
  
  #part 2: read the file in C++
  
  #part 3: convex Hull problem
  
  #part 4: path planning solution - A*
  
  #part 5: Dubbins model
